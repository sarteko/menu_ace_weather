📌 Introduction
The Weather & Time Management Script allows players to dynamically control in-game weather and time through the ACE menu.

⚙️ System Overview
The "time_sector" variable is used to interact with the ACE menu, enabling weather and time adjustments.
Currently, the system is in an early development stage, and some features may require further improvements.
📂 Script Functionality
🔹 Function of OBJ_weather_set.sqf
The OBJ_weather_set.sqf file manages the "time_sector" variable and all related weather and time settings.
The script allows real-time changes to atmospheric conditions via the ACE menu.
Additionally, weather_set.sqf manages the activation of the ACE_Callphone, ensuring that only players with the device can access the weather control menu.
🚀 How to Enable the Script
To properly activate the script, add the following lines to your init.sqf file:

sqf
Copia
Modifica
[] execVM "weather\weather_set.sqf";
[] execVM "weather\OBJ_weather_set.sqf";
✅ This ensures that the script runs at mission startup, enabling dynamic weather and time control.

🖥️ Interacting with the ACE Menu
Once the script is active, players can modify weather conditions directly from the ACE menu.
The ACE_Callphone is required to access the menu.
All changes take effect in real-time, offering flexible and immediate control over the game environment.
