Guide to Activating and Using the Weather and Time Script
Introduction to the System

The "time_sector" variable is used to interact with an ACE menu that allows you to modify the weather and time in the game.
Currently, the system is in an immature version, so some features might still need further development.
Function of the weather_set.sqf File

The weather_set.sqf file handles the "time_sector" variable, which controls the weather and time settings.
This script allows users to dynamically modify the weather conditions during the mission via the ACE menu.
Adding a Device to Enable the Menu

In the future, players will be able to choose a specific device to enable the additional menu within the ACE management menu.
The device that will activate the weather and time management menu is the object named "Item_SmartPhone".
The configuration of this device will be handled through the menu_ace_Wportable.sqf file, allowing players to activate the weather and time options dynamically.
How to Enable the Script in the Mission

To properly activate the script, you need to insert two commands into the init.sqf file of the mission:



[] execVM "weather\weather_set.sqf";
[] execVM "weather\menu_ace_Wportable.sqf";

These commands will execute the scripts at mission startup, enabling the weather and time management functionality.

Interacting with the Menu

Once the scripts are active, players can interact with the ACE menu to modify the weather conditions during the mission.
Changes to the weather and time will take effect in real time, allowing dynamic control.
Future Developments

The current version is still under development, and additional features may be added, such as the ability to select different devices to interact with the weather and time system.
